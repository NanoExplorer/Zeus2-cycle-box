Labjack Sensor Notes

#Other sensors from reverse-engineered labview code:
#Listed functions are what happen when the bit is set to ON
#dio 0   LSB     \
#DIO 1   MSB      |
#DIO 2   DISABLE  | GRT 0-3
#DIO 3   WARM    /
#DIO 4   LSB     \
#DIO 5   MSB      |         dio 4 5
#DIO 6   DISABLE /  GRT 4-6     1 0 reads GRT 5 for example
#DIO 7   LSB     \
#DIO 8   MSB      | 4WIRE 
#DIO 9   DISABLE /
#DIO 10  LSB      \
#DIO 11  2s place  |
#DIO 12  4s place  | 2WIRE
#DIO 13  DISABLE  /
#DIO 14  SERVO MODE
#DIO 15  2 LEDs hanging out of the 4wire - ON=GREEN OFF=RED The current labview program never interacts with this... But it's green right now.

The rest are inputs:
#DIO 16  Cycle box local vs remote
#DIO 17 is set point reached indicator - 0 means set point reached
#dio 18 is quench
#dio 19 is computer/manual

#Ramp rate needs to be divided by 2
#set point current needs to be divided by 20

#LJioputdigitalbit 14 controls servo vs cycle
#That is also called be eio6
#For the bitstatewrite function, it looks like io0-7 are FIO, 8-15 are EIO and 16-19 are cio.
