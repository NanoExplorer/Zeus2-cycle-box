MongoDB Notes
1. We need a replica set in order to do cool things (get real time updates from the server). 
To set it up, go to /etc/mongodb.conf and uncomment /add the following lines:
replication:
   replSetName: rs0
Or, if you for some reason have a STUPID OLD STYLE CONF FILE do this instead
replSet = rs0

2. you only need to do this once: open a mongo shell with `mongo` and run
rs.initiate()
3. NEVER RUN MONGOD AS ROOT. Everything will break and you'll have to do `sudo chown -R mongodb /var/lib/mongodb/*` to fix it.
