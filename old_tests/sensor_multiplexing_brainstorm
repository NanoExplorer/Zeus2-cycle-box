We have a list of sensors to read out.
 1. We could read out the next sensor in the list, keeping track of the last index of that list that was read. so if the list is [1,2,3], last time we read index 0, next time we'll read index 1, and if the index we want to read is > than length, we start over.

 What happens if we read out sensor index 2 (sensor 3) and then someone checked the box to read out sensor 0?
 We'd read sensor 3 twice in a row. But we would know that we did that. 

 2. We could store the last sensor read, and figure out what the next one to read should be.
